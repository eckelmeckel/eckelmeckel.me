## Challenge-Response based Remote Attestation with TPM 2.0

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of the "Challenge/Response Remote Attestation" interaction model of the [IETF RATS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/) [Reference Interaction Models for Remote Attestation Procedures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models/) using TPM 2.0. The [IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/) working group standardizes formats for describing assertions/claims about system components and associated evidence; and procedures and protocols to convey these assertions/claims to relying parties. Given the security and privacy sensitive nature of these assertions/claims, the working group specifies approaches to protect this exchanged data.

This proof-of-concept implementation realizes the Attesting Computing Environment—a Computing Environment capable of monitoring and attesting a target Computing Environment—as well as the target Computing Environment itself, as described in the [RATS Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-birkholz-rats-architecture/).
